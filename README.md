# eCommerce Magazine website design (2017)

This version available in the repository is not the final (unfortunately, I don't have another version in the repository). The process of creating the new website was staged:

1. Prototype in accordance with the guidelines in Axure RP: [Demo](https://demo.berdychowski.com/axure-ecom/)
2. Layout design in Photoshop based on the prototype: [Project](https://dribbble.com/shots/23035752-eCommerce-Magazine-website-design-2017) (note: logging in to Dribbble is required to view) or check folder "screen"
3. Slicing the layout into HTML/CSS using JS and jQuery: You are currently viewing the latest saved version.
4. Integration of the layout with a proprietary CMS written in Symfony: This system has been developed from version 2.x to 4.x.

Thanks to this process, I was able to focus on each stage, ensuring that the final implementation aligns with the set goals and expectations.

## Additional Information

The layout was used for all magazines within the publishing house, with only the color palette being adjusted.
